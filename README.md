This modification attempts to add Dwarf Fortress like object and universe stories to X4 Foundations.

It records actions and encounters made by ships or stations, classifies and clusters them and records them to a universe history.
The object or sector Information contains a new history tab that shows a timeline of the events.

Events are clustered by priority and cleared up periodically to save memory. The more significant an event, the longer it remains in the history.

Requires a modified version of [Kuertees mod extension](https://github.com/RinneT/x4-mod-ui-extensions)

**
This repository is currently unmaintained. The project was created as a proof of concept.
Given X4's massive size, the performance and memory impact even an hour after game start was unsustainable.
